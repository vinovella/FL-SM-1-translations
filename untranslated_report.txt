Line 833: mc "I mean, you {i}could{/i} have."
Line 845: mc "Is there any way I can thank my hero?"

Line 929: dc "Come on, I need to see how bad it is!"
Line 965: mc "All right, I'm ready for my inspection, Doctor Debbie."
Line 977: dc "How's, uhm, how's that feel? Does it hurt?"

Line 1931: dc "I think of you, grabbing my cock, your cock in my ass!"
Line 1937: dc "Or, or, your cock between my tits, in my mouth!"
Line 1943: dc "I think of you cumming all over me as I stroek myself, and I- I-"

Line 2111: dc "Oh, that would be awesome!"
Line 2129: dc "I am so sorry, [mcname], but I have to go. Captain scheduled me for an early shift tomorrow."
Line 2153: mc "Oh? What's the unimportant thing?"
Line 2165: mct "Hmmm... I wonder what she's not saying."
Line 2189: mc "It's alright, it's the life of a public servant."
Line 2213: mc "Debbie, it's okay. You can give me a kiss goodbye."
Line 2243: dc "I think I'm going to sleep like a rock tonight!"

Line 29: dc "I'm sorry that took so long."
Line 53: dc "Why do you think it was a guy?"
Line 83: dc "I'm just messing with you. Dudes are way more likely to steal than women are."
Line 101: dc "And they make up 81.1%% of motor thefts, and 83.6%% of burglary arrests!"
Line 107: mc "And those are facts you just... know?"
Line 113: dc "Uh huh! All part of the cop training I do!"
Line 125: dc "Yep! Statistics can be really enlightening to a police department."
Line 131: dc "You know, where is the most crime happening, what type of crime, the demographics of the population, and what percentage of those individual demographics-"
Line 137: dc "Sorry, you definitely did not have \"Debbie rambles about percentages\" as your 'date' idea."
Line 143: mc "It's okay! I like hearing about your job, Debbie."
Line 155: dc "I used to think that too."
Line 197: dc "There are so many problems, and I... just don't know how to solve them."
Line 215: dc "Okay, for example, last week I had a homeless guy in the park, right?"
Line 227: dc "Pretty normal thing. But, when I tried to ask him to leave, he refused."
Line 239: mc "Okay, but where is he now?"
Line 251: dc "See, police really only have one tool to deal with every situation."
Line 257: dc "So when a situation calls for something, like, deescalation, or something that requires like a social worker's skills..."
Line 263: dc "We just, don't know how to do that."
Line 269: dc "So instead, we remove and arrest. We punish, without heart, without any other solution than to slap a bandaid on the problem, and make it rough enough that it doesn't happen again."
Line 287: mc "If there's anyone I know that can figure something out, it's you."
Line 293: dc "I don't know about that, [mcname]..."
Line 305: mc "You're a bad ass chick."
Line 329: mc "It will work out. I have faith."
Line 335: dc "Thank you, [mcname]. Seriously, that... means a lot."
Line 341: dc "All right, enough about that! What's this big date you have planned?"
Line 353: mc "What if I told you..."
Line 359: mc "I knew where to get the best hot dog in all of Crowning?"
Line 389: dc "I've walked past this cart so many times, and I've always wondered what their hot dogs were like."
Line 419: mc "Oh, sorry, I'll give you a second."
Line 431: mc "What? Disgusting? Horrible? Worst thing you've ever had?"
Line 461: mct "Man, the way Debbie can handle that hot dog..."
Line 467: mct "I can't help but think of a different weiner I'd love for her to be putting-"
Line 473: dc "You okay, [mcname]?"
Line 491: mct "If only she knew what was going on in my head..."
Line 497: mc "No everything is great.{w} But, I do have a confession to make..."
Line 503: dc "And what's that?"
Line 509: mc "When I was planning this date, I only ever got as far as getting hot dogs."
Line 521: mc "Yeah... I tried to think of something we could do, but I just..."
Line 539: mc "And... I wasn't sure what else would be good."
Line 551: dc "All of those sound super fun... but you're right about not having enough time to go hiking..."
Line 563: dc "Oh! You know what could be super fun?"
Line 569: mc "What's that?"
Line 587: dc "Would you want to go?"
Line 599: dc "Yeah! You could see what it's like to be an action hero, and how the movies totally lie about shooting guns."
Line 617: mc "Yeah! Why not! I'm open to new experiences!"
Line 635: dc "Part of the reason I'm thinking about the range is because the department has monthly hours you need to log at the range."
Line 641: dc "It's not super serious, half the guys just go sit at the range and watch movies on their phone."
Line 647: dc "But I like to try and keep up with my skills."
Line 653: dc "And I'd like to do that with you,[mcname]!"
Line 659: dc "You know, show you the ropes, all that!"
Line 683: mc "Whatever - I get to spend time with you! That's what matters!"
Line 725: mc "I just figured we should get our hand muscles all warmed up before we go."
Line 737: mc "So, why do I have to wear these things again?"
Line 743: dc "Because guns are loud. Very loud."
Line 755: dc "Trust me, if you want to be able to hear anything tomorrow, you're going to want to wear them."
Line 761: mc "I feel like they make me look goofy."
Line 797: dc "All right, number one rule about firearms is that you always, {i}always{/i} treat them like they're loaded. Okay?"
Line 803: mc "Okay, always treat them like they're loaded."
Line 809: dc "That is thee most important rule about any and every gun."
Line 815: dc "Because you never know."
Line 839: mc "Down range, never at a person. I can do that."
Line 851: dc "All right, come over here and let's get you started!"
Line 857: dc "All right, so the pistol is now loaded."
Line 863: mc "Okay, good to know."
Line 869: dc "But, what's the most important rule?"
Line 887: mc "All right, and now I just pull the trigger?"
Line 893: dc "Only if you want to tear your shoulder out of its socket!"
Line 899: mc "I really don't want to do that."
Line 911: dc "Okay, and square your shoulders."
Line 941: dc "All right, and lean a little foreward, brace yourself a bit for the recoil..."
Line 959: dc "You're going to slowly, but smoothly, pull the trigger back until it goes bang. Okay?"
Line 977: mc "HOLY SHIT THAT WAS LOUD!"
Line 1007: mc "Sorry, but wow! You weren't kidding! That was super loud!"
Line 1013: dc "Hehehehehe! Yeah, that's why we wear the goofy looking earmuffs!"
Line 1049: jc "Oh would you look at that!"
Line 1079: mc "What's their problem?"
Line 1109: mc "Oh yeah? Why's that not a surprise, huh?"
Line 1163: jc "Hell, she can barely be trusted to hang out in a park!"
Line 1187: jc "I bet you think we're saying that because of her \"situation\"."
Line 1193: jc "Hey man, I don't give a shit what she's got in her skirt."
Line 1229: jc "Oh, you fucking think so?"
Line 1247: mc "This is a gun range, right? Why don't you have a shoot off. Whoever hits the target better wins."
Line 1271: jc "But when I win, little miss park ranger needs to show us the gloryhole we've heard so much about."
Line 1301: mc "You got this. You can beat them, I know it."
Line 1325: mc "Are they the type of guys who come to the range to watch a movie?"
Line 1355: jc "Come on! We going to do this!? You stall much longer, and I'm going to wonder what those saggy tits would feel like around my dick!"
Line 1367: dc "Yeah, I got this."
Line 1379: jc "Pfft! Hope you like doing paperwork then!"
Line 1391: jc "Show you how a real cop gets it done!"
Line 1415: jc "All right, it's all you, cupcake."
Line 1463: dc "Don't believe me, come take a look for yourself!"
Line 1475: jc "There's no fucking way you beat me! Bull shit!"
Line 1481: dc "What, are you saying I cheated?"
Line 1523: mc "It just felt like an appropriate retort?{w} You know, tell them that you are-"
Line 1529: dc "I mean...{w}you want me as your girlfriend?"
Line 1535: mc "I mean... if you want to be."
Line 1547: dc "Because I have a loaded gun, and now is {i}not{/i} a good time to be making a joke."
Line 1553: mc "I mean... there's still a lot we need to learn about each other, but..."
Line 1559: mc "It's complicated, I have... well, I'm involved with-"
Line 1565: dc "I don't care. I {i}only{/i} care about if you want to be involved with me."
Line 1577: dc "You have {i}no idea{/i} how badly I've wanted to hear you say that, [mcname]."
Line 1607: mc "Which means we'll have to do more boyfriend-girlfriend stuff! Dates, holding hands, uhm... other things people who are dating do."
Line 1619: mct "Wow, I didn't realize how much this would mean to her."
Line 1637: dc "Oh, uhm, ahem. So, boyfriend, I, uhm, think I have to go!"
Line 1679: mct "Did she get that awkward because she got a boner?"
Line 1691: mct "Maybe it will take a bit for her to get more comfortable with physical contact between us."
Line 1697: mct "Or maybe not, I don't know..."
Line 1709: mct "Hot dogs and watching Debbie show up some asshole cops.{w} Not bad at all."

Line 47: mc "Nope, just something I need to tell Debbie."
