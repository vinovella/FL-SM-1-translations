    old "Your goal in these puzzles is to fill the whole grid with green and black squares.\n\nAbove and to the left of the grid are numbers. These are the indicator numbers that tell you the number of green squares in that specific row and column.\n\nExample. If the row has a '3' next to it, that means there will be a set of three green (connected) squares somewhere in that row. It is the same for columns based on the numbers at the top of the puzzle. A '2' at the top of a column means that in that column, there is a set of two green squares running vertically."
    new "你在这些谜题中的目标是用绿色和黑色方块填满整个网格。\n\n网格上方和左侧是数字。这些是指示数字，告诉你该特定行和列中绿色方块的数量。\n\n例如。如果行旁边有一个\"3\"，这意味着该行中某处将有一组三个绿色（连续）方块。对于列也是如此，根据谜题顶部的数字。列顶部的\"2\"意味着在该列中，有一组两个绿色方块垂直排列。"

    old "You will notice some rows/columns have 2 numbers.\n\nIf you see '2 1', that tells you that somewhere in that line will be a run of exactly 2 green squares, followed by 1 or more black squares, followed by 1 green square.\n\nThere might be black squares before or after the green squares - only the runs of green squares are counted."
    new "你会注意到有些行/列有2个数字。\n\n如果你看到\"2 1\"，这告诉你在该行中某处将有恰好2个绿色方块的连续排列，后面跟着1个或更多黑色方块，然后是1个绿色方块。\n\n绿色方块之前或之后可能有黑色方块 - 只计算绿色方块的连续排列。"

    old "Left-click on a square to make it green. Right-click to mark with black.\n\nIn our system, the black squares represent the empty or blank squares and the green squares are the coded or filled squares.\n\nYou do not need to fill in the blank squares by marking them if you do not want to. It is not required to solve the puzzle."
    new "左键点击方块使其变绿。右键点击标记为黑色。\n\n在我们的系统中，黑色方块代表空白方块，绿色方块是已编程或已填充的方块。\n\n如果你不想标记空白方块，你不需要填充它们。这不是解决谜题所必需的。"

    old "It is strongly advised never to guess. Only squares that can be determined by logic should be coded or filled green.\n\nIt is easy for a single error to cause inaccuracies across the entire puzzle.\n\nSimple puzzles can usually be solved by figuring out the reasoning by focusing on a single row/column at a time. Then move to the next row and the next row until you have filled all the green squares."
    new "强烈建议永远不要猜测。只有可以通过逻辑确定的方块才应该被编程或填充为绿色。\n\n单个错误很容易导致整个谜题的不准确。\n\n简单的谜题通常可以通过一次专注于一行/列来推理解决。然后移动到下一行和下一行，直到你填满所有绿色方块。"

    old "Some more challenging puzzles may also require several types of reasoning that include more than one row (or column).\n\nYou might think that you have the correct answer for one row, but your answer might not work for an intersecting column. Resolving these contradictions is key to solving more complicated puzzles.\n\nWhen a cell cannot be a coded/green square because some other cell would produce an error, it should be a black/blank square - and vice versa.\n\nWhen you are confident in your solution, click the checkmark to submit the program for code review."
    new "一些更具挑战性的谜题可能还需要几种类型的推理，包括多行（或列）。\n\n你可能认为你有一行的正确答案，但你的答案可能不适用于相交的列。解决这些矛盾是解决更复杂谜题的关键。\n\n当一个单元格不能是已编程/绿色方块，因为其他单元格会产生错误时，它应该是黑色/空白方块 - 反之亦然。\n\n当你对你的解决方案有信心时，点击复选标记提交程序进行代码审查。"
