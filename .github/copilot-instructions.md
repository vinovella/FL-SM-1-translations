## Copilot translation instructions

## Key Guidelines

1. NEVER change or translate placeholders, variables, engine tags, escape sequences, or hotkey markers. Treat them as code tokens, not words. Examples of tokens you must preserve exactly: anything that looks like a placeholder or engine tag.

   - Curly-brace placeholders: `{player_name}`, `{score}`, `{w=0.5}`, `{i}`, `{b}` (engine text tags)
   - Square-bracket substitutions: `[player_name]`, which may be used for python/engine interpolation
   - Percent-based formatting: `%(count)d`, `%.2f`, `%s`
   - Line/escape sequences: `\n`, `\t`, `\r`
   - Any text that is outside quotation marks in code files like - `nointeract`, `who_style`, etc.
2. Preserve punctuation and whitespace that are part of tokens.

   - If a placeholder appears adjacent to punctuation or parentheses, keep the punctuation in the translated string as it appears in the source, unless grammar of the target language strictly requires reordering — in that case, keep the token exactly but move its surrounding punctuation/words.
3. Maintain the order and count of placeholders. If the target grammar requires reordering, use numbered placeholders when available (e.g., `%1$s` or similar) — but only if the original uses them. Do not invent a new placeholder format.
4. Preserve comments and code structure. Only edit the visible strings for translation. Do not modify code logic, variable names, or function calls.
5. Keep tone and register appropriate for the character/context provided. When context indicates a character's gender, age, or specialty, use natural language choices consistent with that context (see Character & Context section below).
6. Context for characters and their gender and speciality is provided here:
